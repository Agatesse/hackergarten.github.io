== How to add an event

If you want to add your event to the Hackergarten website you need to open the https://github.com/hackergarten/hackergarten.github.io/blob/master/events.json[events.json] file by clicking on the edit button (the pen in the upper right corner). After you've done your changes in the file write a commit title and description in the form under the file and submit your changes. The last step is to submit the pull request.
